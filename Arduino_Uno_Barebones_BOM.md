**The original Arduino UNO was not ideal for the space-saving design and after test-fitting the enclosure would not fit, given several instances of poor wire management and the Dupont connectors. A revision was necessary, and it was a good opportunity to test my hand at creating a barebones UNO PCB. Below is a parts list and a short guide, with help from Teachmemicro.com.**

* Breadboard
* U1 - ATMega328 Microcontroller (preferably with Arduino bootloader installed)
* Jumper wires
* LED
* R2 - 470 Ohm resistors
* R1 - 1 x 10k Ohm resistor
* 2 x 10 uF capacitors (not pictured but needed on PCB version, below)
* X1 - 16 MHz clock crystal
* C1, C4 - 2 x 0.1 uF ceramic capacitor
* C2, C3 - 2 x 22 pF ceramic capacitors 
* Pushbutton for reset (not pictured)
* 7805 Regulator IC (not pictured, again for PCB version)
* USB to Serial Converter Breakout Board
